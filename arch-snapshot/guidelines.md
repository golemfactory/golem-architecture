# Golem architecture - guidelines
## Editorial standards
* Language: English
* Audience: Technical, but let’s not assume Golem or blockchain knowledge
* Intended consumption: internal but it may be released publicly
* No direct styling - use markdown concepts (quotes, tables, whatever)
* No “I” or “we” - use impersonal form (e.g. “solution XYZ was chosen”)
* Use header structure
* Single document
## Technicalities
* Markdown + git (new directory on a separate branch in golem-architecture)
* PR per logical change
* MD reviews all PRs
* Linear git history (squash before merge)
* Merge to new-arch
* Diagrams using mermaid
* Spellcheck before creating a PR
