# Golem Architecture

This repository contains documentation and artifacts defining the protocol and architecture for the Golem Project.


This repository contains specification on protocol level and should be baseline for
future implementation. That means that implementation details of [yagna](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna)
or SDKs should be documented in corresponding repositories, not here.
