\section{Golem Plane}

\subsection{Introduction}

On the Golem Plane (GP) are embedded nodes (GN) that communicate with each other using the P2P protocol, creating the Golem Network.
Each node is built on the basis of the Golem Agent (GA (Yagna)). This component consists of:

\begin{itemize}

\item Golem Toolkit (GTK): A set of REST APIs for creating decentralized and distributed applications and services based on the Golem trade model.

\item Golem Local Services (GLS): A set of basic services available within the node. These are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Golem Market Service (GMS): A service that enables the circulation of offers and demands for computational resources.
The purpose of the circulation is to conclude an agreement between the requestor and the provider of computational resources.

\item Golem Activity Service (GAS) : A service that allows for controlled remote launch of the applicant's application on the supplier's computing resources, 
in accordance with the concluded agreement.

\item Golem Payment Service (GPS) : A service that allows for the settlement of the executed agreement between the requestor and the provider 
via a selected payment platform.

\item Golem Net Service (GNS) : A service that manages communication between Golem nodes via P2P protocols.

\end{itemize}

\item Golem Agent Console (GAC) : A Command Line Interface (CLI) used to configure, monitor applications and services on the Golem Agent component.

\item Golem Public Services (GPuS) : A set of services available from other nodes and/or networks.

\item Golem Database (GDB) : An element of the Golem Agent component that allows for recording transactions to the embedded database.

\item Golem Service Bus (GSB) : A Golem Agent component element that enables communication between the binded Golem Local and Public Services.

\item Golem Agent Daemon (GAD) : A module that works as a background process and handles the Golem Agent component elements.

\end{itemize}

In a single node, the above services communicate with each other via the Golem Service Bus (GSB).
In turn, communication between nodes takes place via the Golem Net Service (GNS) service, which provides Peer2Peer (P2P) protocols.

%This service also provides communication to the Registry and Discovery Service located on the Golem Central Net Server (GCNS).

In a single node, the above services communicate with each other via the Golem Service Bus (GSB), the so-called Intra Connection.
In turn, communication between nodes takes place via the Golem Net Service (GNS), which provides Peer2Peer (P2P) protocols, the so-called Inter Connection.
Golem Net Service provides the following communication models

\subsubsubsubsection{Golem Market Service}

This service has functions for creating a market of distributed computing resources.
This service allows sellers (Providers) to describe the subject of sale in the form of an offer
and buyers (Requestors) to describe the subject of demand in the form of a Demand.

In addition, the service allows for decentralized searches of offers and demands in order to associate them
based on the conditions described in offers and demands. Matched objects are represented as
proposal. An accepted and confirmed proposal allows for the creation of an agreement object, which
after being signed by the parties is a confirmation of the sale and purchase of goods such as computing resources.

The Market service is based on the tuple space (Tuples Space).
A tuple is a finite list of elements that can be used to represent a data item or a message.

In the Golem system, in the Market service, tuples are used to describe objects such as:
offer, demand, proposal, agreement. (Please see Figure ~\ref{fig:MF1} on page ~\pageref{fig:MF1}
and Figure ~\ref{fig:MF2} on page ~\pageref{fig:MF2}).

The Market Space is used to define interaction operations on these objects such as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Observation Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Market Observation operation is implemented by a set of Scan functions. 
These functions, together with REST API methods, allow to aggregate data from currently circulating 
offers (Offer object) and demands (Demand object).

The BeginScan() function initiates the scanning operation by accepting the filtering criteria and 
returning scanId. The results are aggregated and collected by the CollectScanResults() function.
The EndScan() function closes the data aggregation process.

The criteria for searching the Golem network market are defined using the service model description language (Golem SMDL),
where the filter syntax is based on the LDAP filter syntax. Depending on the needs, simple or complex search criteria can be defined.

\end{table}

\end{enumerate}

\item  Discovery Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Discovery operation is implemented by a set of Subscribe functions. These functions, together with REST API methods, 
allow for the aggregation of data from currently circulating active offers (Offer object) and active demands (Demand object).

The Subscribe() function publishes the offer (Offer object) and demand (Demand object) on the Golem Network Market, respectively.
The aggregated results in the form of proposals (Proposal object) with matching Demand-Offer pairs are collected by the Collect() function.
The Unsubscribe() function disables the availability of offers and demands on the Golem Network Market.

The Discovery operation is the only one that involves indirect communication (e.g. via a P2P network).
The subsequent phases are direct (one-to-one)

\end{enumerate}

\item  Negotiation Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Negotiation operation is implemented by a set of REST API functions and methods that allow for reaching a consensus between the parties
by matching offers and demands. This is done by automatic or semi-automatic exchange of documents (Offer and Demand objects)
between the parties in the form of proposals (Proposal object). 
The negotiation conditions are described by the service model description language (Golem SMDL) 
where the filter syntax is based on the LDAP filter syntax.

The Collect() function collects aggregated results in the form of proposals (Proposal object) from the data contained 
in the offer (Offer object) and in the demand (Demand object).

The CounterProposal() function In the case of the Requestor node, it creates and sends a modified version of the original demand 
(Demand object as a counterproposal) adapted to the previously received Proposal (i.e. Offer).
In the case of the Provider node, it creates and sends a modified version of the original offer (the Offer object as a counterproposal) 
adapted to the previously received proposal (i.e. Demand). The function for both cases changes the state of the Proposal object to Draft 
and returns the created proposalId. 

The RejectProposal() function effectively ends the negotiation chain - it clearly indicates
that the sender will not create another counterproposal. If the negotiations reach a consensus, 
then an agreement (the Agreement object) is generated by the CreateAgreement() function of the Agreement operation. 

The Provider node retrieves the proposal (Demand) with the given proposalId using the GetProposalDemand() method. 
The Requestor node retrieves the proposal (Offer) with the given proposalId using the GetProposalOffer() method.

\item  Agreement Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Agreement operation is implemented by a set of REST API functions and methods that allow for the finalization of the Negotiation operation by
confirming receipt of the agreement signed by both parties (Agreement object).

The CreateAgreement() function creates an agreement (Agreement object) from the negotiated proposal (Proposal object) by the Requestor node.

The agreement created by the ConfirmAgreement() function is signed with the Applicant's signR key and sent to the Provider.

The RejectAgreement() function is used to interrupt the Agreement operation by the Provider node.

Running the RejectAgreement() function interrupts the Agreement operation, giving the Requestor node the possibility of returning the negotiation operation,
which can send a new proposal (Proposal object).

The CancelAgreement() function is used to interrupt the Agreement operation by the Requestor node.

This is possible only until the Agreement is approved or rejected by the Provider and before it expires.

The WaitForApproval() function is used to set the time to prepare resources to start the calculations as part of the Activity service operation.
This function is initialized by the Requestor node for the Provider node. After the set time has elapsed, the Requestor node can
re-call this function for the same agreement identifier (agreementId).

The ApproveAgreement() function is used to approve the agreement by the Provider node. It is used when the environment with
resources on the Provider node is ready to start the calculations by the Requestor node as part of the Activity service operation.

The TerminateAgreement() function is used to terminate the agreement in the Approved state.
The other party is notified about the decision of the calling party to terminate the "current" agreement. Available for both types of nodes.

The GetTerminateReason method is used to retrieve the reason for termination of the agreement reported during the call to the TerminateAgreement() function. Available for both types of nodes.

The AgreementEvents method is used to collect events related to the agreement (the Agreement object). These are

\begin{itemize}

\item AgreementApprovedEvent : 	indicates that the Agreement has been approved by the Provider.
								The Provider is now ready to accept the request to start the Activity
								as described in the negotiated agreement.
								The corresponding Provider approveAgreement call returns Approved after emitting this event.

\item AgreementRejectedEvent : 	indicates that the Provider has called rejectAgreement, which effectively stops the Agreement negotiation.
								The Applicant can try to return to the Negotiation phase by sending a new Proposal.

\item AgreementCancelledEvent : indicates that the Applicant has called cancelAgreement, which effectively stops the Agreement negotiation.

\item AgreementTerminatedEvent : indicates that the Agreement has been terminated by the specified party (includes a signature).

\end{itemize}

The ListAgreements method is used to retrieve information about agreements. It uses optional filters:

\begin{itemize}

\item state: [Proposal, Pending, Cancelled, Rejected, Approved, Expired, Terminated ]

\item creation date and time

\item application session identifier

\end{itemize}

The GetAgreementContent() function is used to retrieve an agreement (Agreement object) based on a given identifier (agreementId).

The ValidateAgreementContent() function is used to verify an agreement (Agreement object) sent as a byte stream.

\subsubsubsubsection{Golem Activity Service}

This service has tools that allow the Requestor's applications and services to be launched on the Provider's computing resources,
while simultaneously measuring the use of these resources in accordance with the concluded contract in the form of an agreement. 
The measurement of the use of resources is recorded in the form of metrics in the Usage Counters Vector (UCV) object.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsubsubsection{Golem Payment Service}

This service enables settlements between the parties based on the terms contained in the contract. 
Usage Counters Vector (UCV) objects created in the Golem Activity Service and the settlement terms included in the agreement 
are used to settle the sale-purchase item. The Usage Counters Vector (UCV) associated with the agreement and activity creates 
Activity Detail Record (ADR) objects. Settlement functions allow the ADR object to be transformed into a Debit Note (DN) object, 
where the total incremental settlement amounts for using Provider resources are included. The frequency of creating and sending 
Debit Notes objects between the parties is included in the agreement. The state of completing the use of Provider resources allows 
for the generation of an invoice summarizing the agreement between the parties. 
Payment is made via the blockchain operator. Optimization of payment transaction costs is possible by setting the terms of this operation 
in the agreement object.

In the Golem system, in the Payment service, tuples are used to describe objects such as:
vector usage counters, activity detail record, debit note, invoice .

\item Debit Note

\begin{enumerate}

\item Object Description

Debit Note is an object issued by Provider node to Requestor node, in the context of a specific Activity.
Activity Context is defined as a set of computational resource metrics, called Usage Counter Vector.
It is a notification of Total Amount Due incurred by the Activity until the Debit Note is issued.

%This is expected to be used as trigger for payment in upfront-payment or pay-as-you-go scenarios.

Debit Note can be used for payment in the scenario:

\begin{itemize}

\item upfront-payment

Payment in advance makes sense when the Agreement concerns multiple activities and 
the settlement concerns the time of resource lease and not its disposal.

\item pay-as-you-go

Payment with current usage makes sense when the activity on the resources is longer and partial payment terms 
are agreed with optimized transaction costs.

\end{itemize}

Debit Notes means the current Total Amount Due, which is calculated from the beginning of the Activity.
Debit Notes calculate the payment amount based on the difference between the Total Payments 
for the Agreement and the Total Amount Due.

%%%% Payment Operations TODO

The Payment Space is used to define interaction operations on these objects such as:

\begin{enumerate}


\item  Rating Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Rating operation is implemented by a set of functions with REST API methods that allow you to transform measurement 
data into debit note items (Debit Note object) based on the agreed price plan.

The IssueDebitNote() function is used to create a debit note based on the Activity Detail Record object (ADR object).
This object collects measurement data from the Usage Counter Vector (UCV) object of the service in a time interval.
This data is associated with the activity (activityId) and the agreement (agreementId). This function is initialized on the Provider node.
Using the REST /send method allows you to send the created Debit Note object from the Provider node to the Requestor node.
The CollectDebitNoteInvoiceEvent() function is used to collect debit notes and their states from the network.
It listens for events related to the debit note using long polling.
If there are any events, the method associated with the function (/debitNoteEvents) will return them immediately.
If there are none, the method will wait until at least one event occurs or the timeout expires.
The afterTimestamp parameter can be used to get only "new" events.
Setting the parameter value to the timestamp of the last processed event ensures that no event is missed.
The events are persistent, i.e. the API call does not remove event records from the receiving queue.
The AcceptDebitNote() function is used to signal the acceptance of a received debit note by the Requestor node.
The acceptance event is sent to the network. And via the CollectDebitNoteInvoiceEvent() function, this event is collected
by the Provider node.
The CancelDebitNote() function is used to signal the cancellation of a generated debit note by the Provider node.
The RejectDebitNote() function is used to signal the rejection of a received debit note by the Requestor node.
From both nodes, you can call the REST methods /debitNotes and /debitNotes/\{debitNoteId\} to retrieve information about
debit notes.

(Please see Figure ~\ref{fig:RO} on page ~\pageref{fig:RO}).

\item  Billing Operation

\begin{enumerate}

\item Description

The Billing operation consists of functions with REST API methods that are used to implement the process of issuing invoices 
based on the use of the service according to the agreed price plan.

The IssueInvoice() function is used to create and send an invoice (Invoice object) from the Provider node to the Requestor node
in the context of a specific Agreement.
It indicates the total amount due from the Applicant under this Agreement.
After issuing an Invoice, no further Debit Notes will be issued.
Issuing an Invoice means Terminating the Agreement (if it has not already been terminated).
After issuing an Invoice, no Actions are allowed.
The CollectDebitNoteInvoiceEvent() function is used to collect invoices and their states from the network.
It listens for debit note events using long polling.
If there are any events, the method associated with the function (/invoicesEvents) will return them immediately.
If there are none, the method will wait until at least one event occurs or the timeout expires.
The afterTimestamp parameter can be used to get only "new" events.
Setting the parameter value to the timestamp of the last processed event ensures that no event goes unnoticed.
The events are persistent, i.e. the API call does not remove event records from the receiving queue.
The AcceptInvoice() unction is used to signal the acceptance of the received invoice by the Requestor node.
The acceptance event is sent to the network. And via the CollectDebitNoteInvoiceEvent() function, this event is collected
by the Provider node.
The CancelInvoice() function is used to signal the cancellation of the generated invoice by the Provider node.
The RejectInvoice() function is used to signal the rejection of the received invoice by the Requestor node.
From both nodes you can call the REST methods /invoices and /invoices/\{invoiceId\} to retrieve information about invoices.
